# Security Documentation

## Overview

This Home Assistant dashboard implements security best practices to protect your smart home credentials and data.

## Security Features

### 1. No Hardcoded Credentials
- All Home Assistant URLs and access tokens are input by users
- No sensitive information is stored in the source code
- Configuration is handled through a secure interface

### 2. Local Storage Encryption
- Access tokens are encrypted using XOR encryption before storing in localStorage
- While not cryptographically secure, this provides basic protection against casual inspection
- Configuration can be easily cleared from the browser

### 3. Secure Configuration Management
- Users must provide their own Home Assistant URL and long-lived access token
- Configuration is validated before saving
- Clear instructions provided for creating secure tokens

### 4. Input Validation
- URL format validation prevents malformed endpoints
- Token presence validation ensures required credentials are provided
- Error handling for network failures and authentication issues

## Security Recommendations

### For Users

1. **Create Dedicated Tokens**
   - Generate a specific long-lived access token for this dashboard
   - Don't reuse tokens across multiple applications
   - Regularly rotate your access tokens

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for your Home Assistant instance when possible
   - Consider VPN access for remote monitoring
   - Keep your Home Assistant instance updated

3. **Browser Security**
   - Use this dashboard on trusted devices only
   - Clear browser data when using shared computers
   - Keep your browser updated

### For Developers

1. **Never Hardcode Credentials**
   - Always use secure configuration management
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Use environment variables for development

2. **Encryption**
   - Current XOR encryption is basic protection
   - Consider implementing stronger encryption for production use
   - Evaluate Web Crypto API for browser-based encryption

3. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Implement proper timeout handling
   - Log security events appropriately

## Known Limitations

1. **Client-Side Storage**
   - Configuration is stored in browser localStorage
   - Not suitable for shared or public computers
   - Consider server-side storage for multi-user deployments

2. **Basic Encryption**
   - XOR encryption provides minimal protection
   - Tokens are decryptable by anyone with access to the code
   - Suitable for personal use, not enterprise deployment

3. **No Token Rotation**
   - Manual token rotation required
   - No automatic token refresh implemented
   - Users must update tokens manually when they expire

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security issue:

1. Immediately revoke the affected Home Assistant access token
2. Clear browser localStorage
3. Generate a new access token
4. Reconfigure the dashboard with new credentials

## Security Updates

This dashboard will be updated to address security concerns. Monitor for:
- Dependency security updates
- Browser security advisories
- Home Assistant security announcements
